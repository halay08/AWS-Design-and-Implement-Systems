Learn how to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) design patterns, tools, and best practices for the managing the entire application architecture life cycle. This course covers how to identify requirements, plan for implementation, and configure services including EC2, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, VPC, and IAM. Find out how to guide developers and DevOps team members in using recommended cloud application architectures for high availability, fault tolerance, managed costs, scalability, and more.

*This course is also an exam preparation resource, as it covers topics that map to the AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate exam*.

**Topics include**:
- AWS design concepts
- Serverless services
- Server-based services
- Code tools for implementation
- Design trade-offs for AWS applications
